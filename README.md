Stock Market Analysis

Using an Excel file, I write VBA script that analyzes the stock market. Special consideration is given to various workbooks in the same Excel file and vast amounts of rows of data. At the end, the user is able to see the percentage increase or decrease that a specific stock has changed, as well the total yearly change and the total markey volume. 

One image is shown to get an idea of what the final product may look like:
